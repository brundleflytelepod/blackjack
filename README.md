# Blackjack

* [Part 1](README_1.md)
The game layout uses 5 classes: Card, Deck, Player, Hand, and Game State
The Game State class will collect the deck(s) of cards and deal them as well
as implement the turn flow of the game and win/loss conditions. This is subject
to change as I code it out, possibly breaking up Game State into a couple more
classes for Shoe, Deal, Bet.
